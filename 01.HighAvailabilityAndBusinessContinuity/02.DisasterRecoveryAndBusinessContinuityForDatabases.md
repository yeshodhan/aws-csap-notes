Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity for Databases
AWS Architect Professional

* HA for Popular Databases
    * SQL Server = AlwaysOn Availability Groups, SQL Mirroring
    * MySQL = Async replication
    * Oracle = Oracle Data Guard, Oracle RAC
* RDS Multi-AZ Failover
    * Automatic failover to another instance in AZ
        * In case db is rebooted, connection down, az down etc.
    * MultiAZ for Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB uses Amazon's failover tec.
    * SQL Server uses SQL Server Mirroring
    * Amazon Aurora instances stores copies of data in a DB cluster across multiple AZ in single region.
* What are Read Replicas?
    * Read Replicas make it easy for using supported engines' built-in replication to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB Instance for read-heavy database workloads.
    * Only max 5 are supported as of now.
    * When to Use?
        * Scaling beyond the I/O capacity
        * Excess read traffic can be directed to one or more Read Replica
        * Serving read traffic while source DB is unavailable
        * Business reporting or data warehousing scenarios: run in read replica instead of production instance.
        * Remember: Scale - Read Replica, Availability - Multi-AZ
    * Supported Versions
        * MySql 5.6
        * PostgreSQL
            * 9.3.5
        * MariaDB
            * current versions
        * Oracle & SQL Server
            * current versions
    * Create read replica
        * If Multi-AZ is not enabled (disabled)
            * Snapshot will be of primary database
            * I/O suspension for about a minute
        * If Multi-AZ is enabled
            * Snapshot will be of the secondary database
            * No performance hits on primary database
    * Connecting to Read-replica
        * Separate DNS
    * Can be Promoted
        * promote read-replica to its own standalone database.
        * Will BREAK the replication link between primary and secondary
    * Multi-Region Read Replicas
        * MySQL, PostgreSQL or MariaDB
        * Reasons:
            * Improve DR
            * Scale Read operations
            * Easier migration
        * Aurora
            * Clusters can also be read replicated 
            * Both encrypted and unencrypted can be replicated
            * If source is encrypted - read replica also needs to be replicated
        * SQL Server and Oracle DO NOT support multi region
    * Exam Tips
        * Up to 5 read replicas
        * Read replicas in different regions.
        * Read replica's replication is Async only.
        * Read replicas can be built off Multi-AZ databases
        * But read replicas themselves cannot be Multi-AZ currently
        * MySQL supports Read Replicas of Read Replicas.
        * DB Snapshots and Auto backup cannot be supported on Replicas
        * Synchronous replication is used for Multi-AZ
        * Asynchronous replication is used for Read Replicas
        * If ACID is not required, or joins or SQL, consider using DynamoDB rather than RDS.
